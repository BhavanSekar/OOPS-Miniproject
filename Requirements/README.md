# Requirements

## Introduction

• Image deblurring and autofocusing has a wide variety of applications in image processing from CCTV footage deblurring to Autofocusing of microscopic images. The generative adverserial networks and Super resolution Convolution neural networks) are the current areas of research in the former. This algorithm provides a general tool to train a wide variety of images as per requirements( Colour/ Greyscale) and learns accordingly.

•	The algorithm uses error functions customised for image processing algorithms which gives a real measure of accuracy of the algorithm..

## Research

•	The applications of image deblurring are multiple. This algorithm can be used in place of multiple aperture imaging which in turn has a very high maintenance cost and possibility of latent defect. Here, SRCNN algorithm is used for training and options of customised testing is also available.

## Features of our system

The main features of this application includes.

- Leveraging between Time and accuracy based on requirments.

- Smooth loss plots and effective selection of parameters.

- Application in security/science sector and solves many problems.

## Cost and Features with Time

In order to determine the cost to develop Image deblurring algorithm, a few aspects are to be considered first:

•	Size of the Application: More the images, more the time to train.

•	User friendly application: The test file can be writen as a mobile application but at the cost of levearaging the possibility of retraining..

•	If Indian Application firm is chosen to create a Image deblurring system then the cost can range between $25000-$35000. This estimate is when the system is being developed with basic features (for example deblurring images obtained through microscopy)

## Defining our system

The Deblurring of images system provides an algorithm to use Deep learning algorithms to automatically deblur images and produce a sharp output which can be used for a wide applications.
