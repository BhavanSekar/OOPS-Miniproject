# Requirements

## Introduction

• Searching for a book in a real large library is a very tedious process and keeping manual method of tracking book transactions is even more tedious. So through this program we     have come up with a solution which can ease these tasks by implementing a “C program”.In this program we as a user can perform adding, searching the books and more importantly     displaying the information of the books in the library.

•	The library management is a project that manages and stores books information electronically according to students needs.The system helps both students and library manager to     keep a constant track of all the books available in the library. It allows both the admin and the student to search for the desired book.

## Research

•	The number of students studying in a school or a university are much more than one can think of keeping a track of records for the students. Most of the Library Management         system consists of operations such as searching the books, displaying the information of books. 

## Features of our system

The main features of this application includes

- Simple & Easy to Use

- Faster retrieval of information

- Reduced workload of the library staff

- All details of the book will be available on a click

## Cost and Features with Time

In order to determine the cost to develop library management system, a few aspects are to be considered first:

•	Size of the App: More the features, more the cost.

•	Number of Platforms: As the number of platforms are increased cost will also be increased significantly.

•	If Indian App firm is chosen to create a Library Management System then the cost can range between $25000-$35000. This estimate is when the system is being developed with basic features and for a single platform.

## Defining our system

The Library Management System is an application for assisting a librarian in managing a book library in a university. The system would provide basic set of features to add books,user can delete the books from the list and searching the books, displaying the information of books.
